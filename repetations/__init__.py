introduction
------------
Loops are among the most basic and powerful of programming concepts. A loop in a computer program is an instruction
that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer
requires action, it is executed. The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required. Each
time the question is asked is called an iteration.

types
-----
Python has two primitive loop commands for and while

while
-----
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

for
---
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in
other object-orientated programming languages, with the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item
in a list, tuple, set etc.

break
-----
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.

continue
--------
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next.

else-in-while
-------------
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

range() => list
---------------
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and
ends at a specified number.
    1 range(max)
    2 range(starting_value , ending_value_exclusive)
    3 range(start , end, set_gap_default_1)
    4 return list

sum(list) => int
----------------
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

else-in-for
------------
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

nested loops
--------------------
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

When To Use
-----------
?

Difference
----------
WHILE        vs           FOR
?                         ?
?                         ?
?                         ?
?                         ?

Loop over string
----------------
as we know list is just like array in python > string is also array > so you are able to perform loop over.
