conditional statements
----------------------
?

if
--
if condition : if 1 == 1:

elif
----
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

else
----
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

Short Hand If
------------
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

Short Hand If - else
--------------------
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

Short Hand If - else
--------------------
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line.

Short Hand If - else
--------------------
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line.

Short Hand If - else
--------------------
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line.

Short Hand If - elif - else
---------------------------
If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line.

Nested if statements
--------------------
You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.

Comparison Operations
---------------------
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

1 == Equals: a == b
2 != Not Equals: a != b
3 <  Less than: a < b
4 <= Less than or equal to: a <= b
5 >  Greater than: a > b
6 >= Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

Logical Operations
------------------
and = The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
or  = The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
